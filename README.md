Develop an application for analyzing and predicting cryptocurrency trends by:

## Correlation Analysis: 
Comparing data from two or more cryptocurrencies to identify potential correlations. This analysis will help determine observable relationships between various coins, which will be visualized using graphs.

## Predictive Modeling:

- Data Segmentation: Splitting historical cryptocurrency data into two segments.
- Model Testing: Applying a machine learning model to the first data segment to make predictions, then comparing these predictions with the second segment to assess model accuracy.
- Future Predictions: If the model proves effective, extending it to predict future coin prices.

Here’s a structured approach to defining your project requirements and preparing a compelling presentation story.

### Data Analysis Requirements**

1. **Data Sources**:
   - Identify reliable sources for cryptocurrency data, such as historical price data, trading volume, market cap, etc.
   - Ensure real-time or periodic updates if the application will track ongoing trends.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and normalize data to handle missing or inconsistent values.
   - Perform any required transformations, like converting timestamps or adjusting for time zones.
   - Establish standards for data granularity (daily, hourly, etc.) and ensure consistency across different coins.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Define metrics for correlation (e.g., Pearson or Spearman correlation).
   - Set a threshold for significant correlations to help distinguish meaningful relationships from noise.
   - Consider any lagged correlations (e.g., if Coin A influences Coin B with a delay).

4. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Select a suitable machine learning model, such as linear regression, ARIMA, LSTM, or transformer models.
   - Train the model on one slice of historical data and validate it against another to assess predictive accuracy.
   - Establish accuracy metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) to measure model performance and set criteria for acceptable prediction efficiency.

5. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Run statistical tests to validate findings from correlation analysis.
   - Perform model validation using the holdout data slice.
   - Document the findings and patterns discovered in the analysis phase.


### Visualization Requirements**

1. **Correlation Visualization**:
   - Use heatmaps to visualize correlation coefficients between different cryptocurrencies.
   - Offer interactive charts (e.g., line charts with selectable overlays) to display comparative trends between pairs or groups of coins.

2. **Historical Data Trends**:
   - Provide line graphs or candlestick charts for individual coin trends over time (price, volume, etc.).
   - Enable multi-line overlays to show the trends of different coins side-by-side.

3. **Prediction Accuracy Visualization**:
   - Display prediction results vs. actual values for the validation data slice using line charts.
   - Include error bars or shaded regions to represent prediction confidence intervals.
   - Summary metrics (e.g., accuracy scores) displayed visually with gauges or bar charts.

4. **Future Predictions**:
   - If prediction proves viable, create a forecasting chart showing predicted prices with a confidence interval band.
   - Allow users to adjust forecast parameters interactively, such as time horizon.

5. **User Interface Features**:
   - Interactive dashboards where users can adjust filters (e.g., date range, coin selection).
   - Hover effects or tooltips to show exact data points on visualizations for detailed analysis.
